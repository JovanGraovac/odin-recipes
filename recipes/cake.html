        <li>Pour the batter into two prepared round cake pans. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. </li>
        <li>While the cake finishes cooling to room temperature, make the frosting: Cream the butter, stir in the cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla, and beat until it's smooth and spreadable.</li>
        <li>When the cake is completely cooled, top each layer with the frosting. Stack them and continue frosting until the cake is completely covered.</li>
